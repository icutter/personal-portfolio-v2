## Gameplay

I designed and implemented roots and platforms mechanics, and created editor tools to place them in the world.

The platforms move on an update that is in sync with the music, to help understand the timing.
Roots extend/retract logic predetermines if the roots have enough time to reach a static position before the start of the next move update.
Depending on the results the roots will move or play a stuck animation.
In addition, the roots actions performed just before the end of the move loop are queued and executed when it ends.

The "stick to wall" ability complements the others by allowing to use the platforms to move in unusual ways.
I'm responsible for making it work and ensure that the character never gets stuck inside walls and platforms.
