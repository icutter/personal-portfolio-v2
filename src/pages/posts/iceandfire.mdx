## My contributions

<Collapsible title="Player controller" important>
  Developed player controller that allows to move, dash, perform a variety of attacks and combos.

  ### Traversal abilities
  1. **Move**: move in the facing direction
  1. **Dash**: A quick movement in the facing direction, with a cooldown
  1. **Ride gayser**: Ride a gayser following a fixed trajectory to reach higher places

  ### Combat abilities
  _Each is either hot or cold, and can affect player temperature_
  1. **Base attack**: Pretty quick melee attack, main source of output damage
  1. **Heavy attack**: Heavier and slightly slower melee attack
  1. **Charged attack**: Powerful melee attack that takes some time to charge
  1. **Dash attack**: Chain melee attack to a dash
  1. **Projectile Launch**: launches a projectile in the facing direction
      - Aim aid system silently adjusts controller input to gracefully snap to enemies
  1. **AOE attack**: Area of effect attack that deals damage to all enemies in a radius around the player
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Combat system" important>
  Built framework on top of Unity to handle hitboxes for applying and receiving damage, as well as parrying attacks.

  Each character has a single "CollisionRoot" component that manages all the children hitboxes and hurtboxes,
  allowing for complex interactions where multiple collision events are taken into account at the same time
  (e.g. ignoring hitbox damage if it has been parried in the same frame).

### Other notable features

<Collapsible title="Team management">
  The project was managed using the Scrum methodology, with one-week sprints.
  A Kanban board (HackNPlan) was utilized to track tasks and monitor progress throughout the development cycle.
  Sprint reviews were held at the end of each week on Discord to assess completed tasks and plan for the next sprint.
  
  Most of the design and planning was done in Google Documents, where we created:
  1. Design documents
  1. Technical documents
  1. Art bible
