{frontmatter.title} is an **augmented reality** arcade shooter for Android, developed as a personal **learning project**.
The main objective is to protect a floating AR island from **increasingly powerful waves** of enemy planes and aircrafts by **shooting at them from your phone**.<br />
The game world can be scaled and placed on the ground. Works great indoors, but can be played virtually everywhere.

<p style="color: orange">Note: This project was originally published on Play Store but is currently unavailable due to the closure of my account after a year of inactivity. The removal was unrelated to the app's content or quality, and the project remains fully functional as showcased here.</p>

## My contributions

<Collapsible title="Gameplay programming">
  Shooting mechanics, enemy AI, game world scaling and placement.

<Collapsible title="Resizable game world">
  The game world can be scaled and placed on the ground.
  Works great indoors, but can be played virtually everywhere.
  Cannon meshes are scaled accordingly, to keep the distance between projectiles proportional to the size of the world.
  They are also moved closer to the camera, so that they occupy the same screen space at any size.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Object pooling system" important>
  Implemented object pooling system for projectiles,
  allowing for efficient reuse of game objects and reducing the overhead of instantiating and destroying objects.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Play Games integration" important>
  ### Online saves

  </InlineBadge>

  ### Leaderboards
  Player scores are automatically uploaded to the global leaderboard, which is updated in real time.
