## My contributions

<Collapsible title="Open world dynamic loading system" important>
  The loading system was inspired by a GDC talk from the developers of Firewatch.
  Unfortunately the video is no longer available,
  but the gist of it is that the game world is divided into chunks,
  and only the chunks that are close to the player or visible from a distance (with LODs) are loaded into memory.
  This allows for a large game world to be loaded seamlessly and with no performance issues.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Grid-based movement and world">
  Implemented grid based movement, and extended Unity tilemap system to create and edit world chunks in a 3D grid.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Dialogue system">
  Implemented dialoue system on top of [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) that allows for:
  1. Branching dialogues
  1. Contextual item inspection text (affected by world state)
  1. Actions or animations triggered by dialogue choices or progression
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Save system" important>
  Designed a save system with manual and auto save functionality,
  using [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) for its powerful serialization features.

  Manual saves are managed by the player, while auto saves are triggered by specific events in the game world.
  In case of game over the latest save is loaded, but the manual save is the only one kept between game sessions.

  Savable objects are easily editable by adding a "UniqueId" component to them, and assigning methods to Unity events.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="UI system">
  Management of UI panels with a custom pushdown automata system.
  This includes prompts in the game world,
  item descriptions, dialogue interface,
  puzzle views and contextual prompts for player inputs.
