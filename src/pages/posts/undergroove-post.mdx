<div style="text-align: justify">
  {frontmatter.title} is a <b>2.5D puzzle platformer</b> developed in 10 days for Global Game Jam 2023.
  The puzzles involve controlling the growth of roots to lock/unlock moving platforms.
  Everything is made of 3D tiles, and the platforms movement is in sync with the music to help understand the timing.
