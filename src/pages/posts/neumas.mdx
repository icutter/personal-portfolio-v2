## My contributions

<Collapsible title="Game Design">
  Designed mechanics for Wave towers, Laser towers and Piano Roll emitter.
  Gathered references and drew sketches to explain their looks and functionalities.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Collision detection logic">
  The game features hazards with peculiar shapes, that required specific collision detection logic to be implemented.
  - Wave towers emit concentric waves of energy.
  - Laser towers emit laser beams that span an angle.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Audio implementation" important>
  The main feature of the game is the synchronization of gameplay to audio events.<br />
  Each hazard is a physical representation of a sound in the game's soundtrack,
  and is triggered whenever that sound is played.
  These objects are also used to emit the spatialized audio for their corresponding sound,
  so that the music shifts and changes as you move between them.<br/>
  This was made possible by using FMOD integration to fire events to the game,
  so that the soundtrack is actually driving the whole action of the game.
