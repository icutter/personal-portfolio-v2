{frontmatter.title} is a **3D top-down action game** made for [Global Game Jam 2022](https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2022/games/neden-3).<br/>
The gameplay focuses on the balance between offensive and defensive modes, leading to radical shifts in gameplay, camera perspective and AI behavior.

## My contributions

<Collapsible title="Gameplay programming">
Developed character controller with movement, dash, trap placement and knives throw.<br/>
Created system that allows to switch between two game modes, adjusting player moveset, enemy AI, camera and post-processing accordingly.<br/>
Implemented object pooling system for knives and traps. Probably a bit overkill in retrospect.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Object pooling system">
Implemented object pooling system for projectiles, allowing for efficient reuse of game objects and reducing the overhead of instantiating and destroying objects.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Enemy AI (FSM)">
Implemented finite state machine for enemy AI, managing their behavior and transitions between states.

<Collapsible title="Dynamic audio integration">
