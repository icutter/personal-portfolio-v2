{frontmatter.title} is a <b>2D puzzle platformer</b> where the player controls two characters on distinct planes of existence.<br />
They cannot interact with each other, and are blocked by walls made of their material (Solid and ghost).<br />
The game achieved the 52nd place for the best mechanics in [GameDevTV Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-jam-2023).

## Gameplay

Implemented character movement and grab ability, making sure that it is possible to carry each other on the cube.
Programmed camera dynamic framing and all interactive objects.

## Level Design
I crafted four levels and conducted refinements on others,
which involved the refactoring and simplification of the final level.

**Polishing:** Added drop to teach the box-grabbing mechanic.

**LV 2 design:** Teaches players they can launch the cube upwards.

**LV 4 design:** Teaches players they can carry each other on the cube.

**LV 6 design:** Guides players toward an apparent solution,
just to reveal the catch: cubes can't pass through gates.
This one also includes the upward cube launch introduced in LV 2.

**LV 8 design:** "The Bridge" level. Uses the cube carry in a more complex way.
