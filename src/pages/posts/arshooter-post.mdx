{frontmatter.title} is an **augmented reality** arcade shooter for Android, developed as a personal **learning project**.
The main objective is to protect a floating AR island from **increasingly powerful waves** of enemy planes and aircrafts by **shooting at them from your phone**.<br />
The game world can be scaled and placed on the ground. Works great indoors, but can be played virtually everywhere.
