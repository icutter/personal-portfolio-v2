## Level Design

I designed 4 levels, on top of performing some polishing on the others.<br />
This includes refactoring and simplifying the final level.

**Polishing:** Added drop to teach box grabbing mechanic.

**LV 4 design:** Teaches that you can carry the other player on the cube.

**LV 6 design:** Fake door level that tricks you into an obvious solution,
just to reveal the catch: cubes can't pass through gates.
This one also features the cube launch mechanic introduced in previous levels.

**LV 7 design:** Generic doors level

**LV 8 design:** "The Bridge" level. Uses the cube carry in a more complex way.
