I designed and implemented mechanics for roots and platforms, and developed editor tools for their placement in the game world.

The platforms move on an update that is synchronized with the music, to help get the timing right.
The roots' extend/retract logic determines whether they have enough time to reach a static position before the next move update.
Depending on the outcome, the roots will either move or play a stuck animation.
Additionally, actions performed by the roots just before the end of the move loop are queued and executed when it concludes.

The "stick to wall" ability complements these mechanics, allowing players to use platforms to move in unconventional ways.
I'm responsible for making it work and ensuring the character never gets stuck inside walls and platforms.
