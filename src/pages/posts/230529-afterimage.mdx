{frontmatter.title} is a **2D puzzle platformer** where the player controls two characters on distinct planes of existence.<br />
They cannot interact with each other, and are blocked by walls made of their material (Solid and ghost).<br />
The game achieved the 52nd place for the best mechanics in [GameDevTV Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-jam-2023).

## My contributions

<Collapsible title="Gameplay design and development">
Implemented character movement and grab ability, making sure that it is possible to carry each other on the cube.
Programmed camera dynamic framing and all interactive objects.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Level Design">
I crafted four levels and conducted refinements on others,
which involved the refactoring and simplification of the final level.

**Polishing:** Added drop to teach box-grabbing mechanic.

**LV 2 design:** Teaches players how to launch cubes upwards.

**LV 4 design:** Teaches players how to carry each other on cubes.

**LV 6 design:** Leads to an apparently simple solution,
just to reveal that cubes can't pass through gates.
This also builds on the upward cube launch mechanic introduced in LV 2.

**LV 7 design:** Generic doors level

**LV 8 design:** "The Bridge" level. Uses the cube carrying mechanic in a more complex way.
