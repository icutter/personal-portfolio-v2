<div style="text-align: justify">
  PoC for a <b>mobile multiplayer roguelite game</b> that runs as a widget inside a Flutter instant messaging app.
  It automatically creates matches based on the users inside the chat-room, showing their avatars interacting in the game and progressing in <b>sponsored biomes</b>.
  <br />
  The characters leveling is based on the actions taken in the chat (<i>e.g. amount of messages, message length, media content</i>), and the system <b>awards NFTs</b> for winning fights and progressing in new areas. This PoC helped company raise <b>300,000$ investments</b> from companies willing to integrate custom sponsored content.
