## My contributions

<Collapsible title="Player controller">
  Very responsive movement, with precise jumping and air control,
  with a focus on future platforming and traversal mechanics.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Combat system">
  Developed a set of custom components to use as hitboxes, hurtboxes and other collision shapes,
  integrated with a base character class to allow for easy customization and reuse.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Bossfight" important>
  Developed a generic AI system using a hierarchical finite state machine (HFSM),
  that can be plugge into any character and powers the boss behavior.

  The bossfight start trigger is integrated with the camera system,
  allowing for scripted camera movements and to swap camera behavior and bounds when entering/exiting the fight.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Camera transitions system">
  Developed a custom camera transition system that supports animations and different modes,
  currently one for esploration and one with locked bounds and y-axis for the boss fight.
