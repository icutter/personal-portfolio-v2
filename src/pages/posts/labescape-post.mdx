Vertical slice for a distinctive top-down hack & slash game, where the focus shifts from limiting
damage taken to balancing your character's temperature and maintaining it at a stable level.

## Gameplay
- Unit movement
- Unit abilities

The FSM library I developed to manage turns, player inputs and UI is available in its own [repo](https://github.com/ironcutter24/cs-state-machine) under MIT license.
Here is a usage example:
```csharp
private StateMachine<State> sm = new StateMachine<State>(State.FirstState);

sm.Configure(State.FirstState)
    .SubstateOf(State.BaseState)
    .OnEntry(() => { /* Entered */ })
    .OnProcess(() => { /* Processing... */ })
    .OnExit(() => { /* Exited */ })
    .AddTransition(State.OtherState, () => firstCondition())
    .AddTransition(State.AnotherState, () => secondCondition());
```

## Utility based AI
- Modular score calculation methods, trying to achieve goals like: get close to attack targets, avoid attack trajectories, avoid getting surrounded.
- It is possible to create multiple AIs composing score calculation methods.
